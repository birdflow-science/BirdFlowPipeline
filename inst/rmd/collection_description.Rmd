## Overview

This BirdFlow model collection contains fitted models of bird movement
trained from 
[eBird Status and Trends (S&T)](https://science.ebird.org/en/status-and-trends) 
weekly distributions. They can be
used with the 
[BirdFlowR R Package](https://birdflow-science.github.io/BirdFlowR/) to generate
synthetic migration routes or to 
predict where birds at a known location and time are likely to be at another 
point in time.
